# Jobchaser
Jobchaser is a school project designed to ease the job searching process by continuously providing the jobs you’re looking for. Whether you're searching for your first job or hundredth, this app is here to assist you. If you stumble on an interesting job ad and want to save it, there's a save button on the top right corner that allows you to do so. The job ad will be saved to your account. If you find an interesting job and click on the job title the app will direct you to platsbanken (arbetsförmedlingen) where you can start the applying process.

# Fetures
- <b>Up to date job listings</b>: As a user you have access to jobs posted on arbetsförmedlingen. To filter through jobs you need to specify your search by writing a specific job title, keyword or city.  

- <b>Bookmark job ads</b>: Save job ads. This feature makes it easy to revisit and apply to them later.

- <b>Create an account</b>: There are two methods to create an account, one by using email and password and the other by using Google. when registering with Google, your current Google profile picture will automatically become your Jobchaser profile picture. And by registering with email and password your account will be assigned an anonymous person icon as a profile picture.

- <b>Verify your account</b>: Receive an email verification by clicking on the gray checkmark, sent to the email registered with your account. If the account was created using Google it’ll automatically get verified. Currently, there are no additional benefits for a verified account, but there will be in the future.

# Status
This project has been put on hold. I have chosen to still share the project because the main focus is the distribution of job ads and all the extra features as for example benefits for verification will be added and completed at a later date. 

# Usage
As soon as Jobchaser is up and running you can start your job searching process. If you want to access the save functionality, you’ll need to create an account and sign in. Good luck!
